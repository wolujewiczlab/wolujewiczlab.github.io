    <h3>Neurogenomic Disorders</h3>
    <p>We employ whole genome sequencing and multi-omic data integration to identify genetic variants and molecular pathways associated with neurological conditions. Our work involves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Variant Discovery</strong>: Advancing approaches to detect and interpret the pathogenic impact of genomic variation</li>
      <li><strong>Gene Expression Profiling</strong>: Analyzing transcriptomic and single-cell datasets</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-omic Integration</strong>: Integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data with systems biology to understand disease mechanisms</li>
      <li><strong>Machine Learning & AI</strong>: Developing predictive models for variant pathogenicity, disease risk assessment, and mechanistic insights</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tick-borne Pathogen Metagenomics</h3>
    <p>We investigate the microbial ecology of tick vectors using cutting-edge metagenomic and sequencing approaches to understand pathogen diversity, genomic organization, and co-infection patterns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In-house Long-read Sequencing</strong>: Generating high-resolution genomic and metagenomic data using Oxford Nanopore technology</li>
      <li><strong>Pathogen Detection</strong>: Developing sensitive methods for identifying known and novel tick-borne pathogens</li>
      <li><strong>Ecological Dynamics</strong>: Understanding temporal and spatial variations in tick microbiomes</li>
      <li><strong>Public Health Applications</strong>: Translating findings into improved surveillance and prevention strategies</li>
    </ul>
