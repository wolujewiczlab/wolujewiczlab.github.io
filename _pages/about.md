    <h3>Neurogenomic Disorders</h3>
    <p>We employ whole genome sequencing and multi-omic data integration to identify genetic variants and molecular pathways associated with neurological conditions. Our work involves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Variant Discovery</strong>: Advancing approaches to detect and interpret the pathogenic impact of genomic variation</li>
      <li><strong>Gene Expression Profiling</strong>: Analyzing transcriptomic and single-cell datasets</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-omic Integration</strong>: Integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data with systems biology to understand disease mechanisms</li>
      <li><strong>Machine Learning & AI</strong>: Developing predictive models for variant pathogenicity, disease risk assessment, and mechanistic insights</li>
    </ul>
